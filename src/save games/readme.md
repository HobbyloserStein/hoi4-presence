# Autosaves

The autosaves in the stage of development will stay in this folder.

There's an example of an save game in the folder. The save game is extense, I put only the necessary to show the structure of the save game.

You can generate your own save game saving a non-binary file and putting it in this folder.

Remember that the save game must be new (or recently modified) to be loaded in the presence and the presence will exit if the game isn't running. Wait 30 seconds to the presence display.

> ``Hint``: You can edit the code and not lose time to test.
